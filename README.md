# Study Recap Guides For Security+  
These are my personal revision notes for **CompTIA Security+**, created to help me consolidate my learning and understand key concepts. Over time, I found them useful for other students preparing for the exam as well.  

Each recap guide includes timestamps from the original study sessions, questions asked and answered during lessons, as well as acronyms and analogies to help reinforce and retain key Security+ concepts.

I hope this helps you with your CompTIA Security+ studies too.
